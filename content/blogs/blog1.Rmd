# Story of the visualisation

As starting point, I analysed changes in the number of Stop & Search operations and detected offenses over time from October 2017 until September 2020. While the plots showed a significant increase in the number of both over time, the percentage of detected offenses compared to the number of stop & search operations decreased from 31.3% to 24.9%.
Furthermore, the distribution of objects of search and of ethnicity of the searched individuals did not change over time. Having detected this, I decided to not look at changes over time when it comes to these variables but rather at other variables.
To analyse the geographical distribution of stop & search operations as well as of the detected offenses, I map the respective numbers for each ward. The distribution of searches and crimes is not homogeneous, but they preliminary happen in the centre of London. But, no significant difference between the distribution of stop & search operations and detected offenses can be seen. Therefore, in my further analysis I will focus solely on the geographical distribution of number of detected offenses.
Finally, I plot the data on the map of London grouped by ethnicity and by object searched to detect patterns in the geographical distribution. From the created maps it is evident, that the detection of crimes related to offensive weapons is more geographically dispersed than related to drugs or stolen goods. Moreover, detected offences committed by white people are more concentrated in the centre of London compared to Black and Asians
