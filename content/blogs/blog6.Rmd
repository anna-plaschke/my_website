```{r setup}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  message = FALSE, 
  warning = FALSE, 
  tidy=FALSE,     # display code as typed
  size="small")   # slightly smaller font for code
options(digits = 3)

# default figure size
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width=6.75, 
  fig.height=6.75,
  fig.align = "center"
)
```


```{r load-libraries, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)  # I am loading ggplot2, dplyr, and all the other tidyverse packages
library(mosaic)
library(ggthemes)
library(lubridate)

# Where Do People Drink The Most Beer, Wine And Spirits?
Let's first load the data:
```{r load_alcohol_data}
library(fivethirtyeight)
data(drinks) #I load in the dataset from the fivethirtyeight package
```
  
  
**(1) - Exploring the variable types and checking for any missing values**

```{r glimpse_skim_data}

glimpse(drinks) #I glimpse() the dataset in order to preview the data entries themselves
skim(drinks) # I use skim() to obtain all the necessary information (variable types, missingness, distribution)

```

Skim demonstrates that the 'drinks' dataset has 193 rows (entries) and 5 columns (variables). These variables are: country; beer_servings; spirit_servings; wine_servings; and total_litres_of_pure_alcohol. There are no missing values in the dataset. 

Variable types are as follows:

- country | the name of the country | type:character
- beer_servings | servings of beer in average serving sizes per person | type: numeric (integer)
- spirit_servings | servings of spirits in average serving sizes per person | type:numeric (integer)
- wine_servings | servings of wine in average serving sizes per person | type: numeric (integer)
- total_litres_of_pure_alcohol | total litres of pure alcohol per person | type:numeric (double)  


**(2) - Top 25 beer consuming countries**

I make a plot that shows the top 25 beer consuming countries:
```{r beer_plot}

#I use the pipe to select only the beer_servings variable, and arrange countries in descending order of serving

beer <- drinks %>% 
  select(country, beer_servings) %>% #select the volumns country and beer
  arrange(desc(beer_servings)) #arrange in descending order

#I again use the pipe to select only the top 25 entries in the list created above

top25_beer <- beer %>% 
  
  head(25) #top25

#I use ggplot() to plot only the top 25 entries summarised in top25_beer, adjusting the x-axis labels for readibility, as well as colour, axis labels and title

ggplot(top25_beer, aes(x = reorder(country, desc(beer_servings)), y= beer_servings),)+
  geom_col(fill="blue") + #choosing tyoe of plot and adding color
  labs(x="Country",y = "Beer Servings Consumed Per Person", title = "Top 25 Beer Consuming Countries") + #adding titles
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=30, size=7)) #change angle of text of x-axis

```
This plot shows that Namibia is the top beer-consuming country, followed by the Czech Republic, Gabon, Germany and Lithuania.  

**(3) - Top 25 wine consuming countries**

Now, I make a plot that shows the top 25 wine consuming countries:
```{r wine_plot}

#We use the pipe to select only the beer_servings variable, and arrange countries in descending order of serving

wine <- drinks %>% 
  select(country, wine_servings) %>% 
  arrange(desc(wine_servings))

#We again use the pipe to select only the top 25 entries in the list created above

top25_wine <- wine %>% 
  
  head(25)

#We use ggplot() to plot only the top 25 entries summarised in top25_wine, adjusting the x-axis labels for readibility, as well as colour, axis labels and title

ggplot(top25_wine, aes(x = reorder(country, desc(wine_servings)), y= wine_servings),) + geom_col(fill="red") + labs(x="Country",y = "Wine Servings Consumed Per Person", title = "Top 25 Wine Consuming Countries") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=30, size=7))


```
This plot shows that France is the top wine-consuming country, followed by Portugal, Andorra, Switzerland and Denmark. 

**(4) -Top 25 spirit consuming countries**

Now, I make a plot that shows the top 25 spirit consuming countries:
```{r spirit_plot}

#I use the pipe to select only the beer_servings variable, and arrange countries in descending order of serving

spirit <- drinks %>% 
  select(country, spirit_servings) %>% 
  arrange(desc(spirit_servings))

#I again use the pipe to select only the top 25 entries in the list created above

top25_spirit <- spirit %>% 
  
  head(25)

#I use ggplot() to plot only the top 25 entries summarised in top25_spirit, adjusting the x-axis labels for readibility, as well as colour, axis labels and title

ggplot(top25_spirit, aes(x = reorder(country, desc(spirit_servings)), y= spirit_servings),) + 
  geom_col(fill="dark green") + 
  labs(x="Country",y = "Spirit Servings Consumed Per Person", title = "Top 25 spirit Consuming Countries") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=30, size=7))

```
This plot shows that Grenada is the top spirit-consuming country, followed by Belaris, Haiti, Russia and St. Lucia.  

**(5) - What can you infer from these plots?**

Namibia, France and Grenada have the largest per capita consumption of beer, wine and spirits, respectively. Unsurprisingly, these countries are some of the largest producers of the alcohols they consumed most. While we are familiar with French wine production, releasing 7-8 billion bottles per year, less known is Namibian ('German') beer production or Granadian spirit (read 'Rum') production figures. 

Namibia Breweries Limited (NBL) produces 214 million litres of Beer, including Tafel Lager, Heiniken and Guiness. Though approximately 60% of its production is exported, predominantly to South Africa, given the country's small (2.4 million) population, beer is widely and cheaply available, and readily consumed. Similarly, with 4 major rum distillers and a population of just 111,000 people, spirit consumption in Grenada is high even relative to infamous Russian, or even Belarusian, levels. 

Finally, comparing the plots to one another, we find that the level of consumption is considerably higher in the Top 25 consumers of Spirits, than amongst the consumers of Wine or Beer. Given that spirits are generally produced in far lower volumes than either wine or beer, retaining a larger share of spirit production to meet domestic consumption demand seems to be a logical assumption. This implies that top spirit consuming countries (and thus producers) potentially export a lower share of their production than top wine and beer producing (consuming) countries. This would help to maintain depressed prices (in France, foreign export demand inflates domestic prices), fueling disproportionately high domestic consumption relative to major wine and beer producing countries.
